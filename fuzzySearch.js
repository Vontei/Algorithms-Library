/// What about:   nesting loops and assigning a binary
// you can assign 0 or 1 if the letters match or not in the string,
// vs the string in the array.  Then you can say that when you reduce the array
// of numbers, if you are in a tolerance range of two maybe, in between two given numbers
// you can return a positive match

/// so loop
/// loop
/// assign 1 or 0 if matching
/// return numbers
/// reduce numbers
/// return letters
/// if numbers are in between
